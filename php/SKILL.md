# PHP

Use this runbook for PHP-level concerns. If a framework-specific skill or
project guide exists, consult it first and keep its conventions primary. Apply
the generic rules below only where the framework does not own the behavior.

## Runbook

Follow these steps in order.

### 0. Choose the branch

- For framework-owned HTTP, routing, validation, ORM, sessions, CSRF,
  serialization, and exception rendering, use the framework APIs and
  configuration. Verify their behavior instead of replacing them with
  framework-agnostic examples.
- For plain PHP, framework-independent libraries, or a missing
  framework-specific guide, apply the relevant generic sections below.
- Apply PHP language/runtime, dependency, security invariant, and verification
  rules whenever they are relevant, regardless of framework.

Completion criterion: the task is classified as framework-owned, generic PHP, or
both, and the framework's source of truth is known.

### 1. Establish the runtime floor

- Inspect `composer.json`, `composer.lock`, `.php-version`, Dockerfiles, CI, and
  the production runtime.
- Record the lowest supported PHP version, required extensions, framework, entry
  points, and existing commands for tests, linting, formatting, and static
  analysis.
- Treat the lowest declared PHP version as the syntax and standard-library
  floor. If project files disagree, surface the conflict before choosing newer
  syntax.

Completion criterion: the target runtime, framework conventions, and
verification commands are known or explicitly stated as assumptions.

Before using a feature newer than that floor, consult
[the PHP version matrix](references/php-version-matrix.md).

### 2. Trace before editing

- Read the target file, its tests, configuration, and the callers or consumers
  affected by the change.
- Follow the real data flow from the input boundary to output and side effects.
- Reuse existing project helpers and conventions. Add an abstraction only at a
  real boundary or when multiple implementations need it.

Completion criterion: every changed path and its observable failure cases are
identified.

### 3. Implement with explicit types

- Use `declare(strict_types=1);` in new files and deliberate migrations; do not
  add it across an existing codebase blindly.
- Type parameters, properties, and return values. Keep `mixed`, untyped arrays,
  and dynamic shapes at integration boundaries, then normalize them into typed
  objects or documented arrays.
- When property hooks are available, use them when a property remains the API
  but reads or writes need normalization, validation, or a computed value. Keep
  hooks small and side-effect-light; use methods for multi-step domain actions.
  Verify ORM, hydrator, serializer, proxy, and static-analysis support before
  migrating a model.
- Prefer enums for closed sets, value objects for domain invariants, and `final`
  or `readonly` when immutability is intentional.
- When asymmetric visibility is available, use `public protected(set)` or
  `public private(set)` for read-public, write-restricted state. Properties must
  be typed and non-static, and `set` visibility cannot be wider than `get`.
  Unlike `readonly`, asymmetric visibility permits controlled internal mutation.
- When available, use `RoundingMode` with an explicit `round()` mode for
  financial or precision-sensitive calculations; test tie cases and negative
  values.
- Use dependency injection for I/O and time; avoid hard-coded mail, filesystem,
  or network clients inside domain logic.
- For Unix timestamps, use `DateTimeImmutable::createFromTimestamp()` when the
  runtime floor provides it, including fractional seconds. Set the intended
  timezone explicitly and test range and precision boundaries.
- Use named arguments only with APIs whose parameter names are part of a stable
  contract.
- Avoid dynamic properties. Use `never` only for code paths that always throw or
  terminate.

Completion criterion: modified public boundaries have clear input and output
contracts, and no feature exceeds the runtime floor.

### 4. Keep boundaries secure

Apply these rules directly to raw boundaries. When a framework owns a boundary,
use its validated request, escaping, ORM, session, or CSRF mechanisms and audit
their configuration instead of bypassing them.

- Validate and normalize untrusted input at the boundary. Validation is not
  output escaping.
- Escape for the output context: HTML, URL, and JavaScript each require
  different handling. For HTML text or attributes, use
  `htmlspecialchars($value, ENT_QUOTES | ENT_SUBSTITUTE, 'UTF-8')`.
- For Unicode-aware text, use `mb_trim()`, `mb_ltrim()`, `mb_rtrim()`,
  `mb_ucfirst()`, and `mb_lcfirst()` when `mbstring` is available; normalization
  does not replace context-specific output escaping.
- Hash passwords with `password_hash()` and verify with `password_verify()`.
  Rehash after `password_needs_rehash()` succeeds.
- Generate tokens with `random_bytes()` or `random_int()`, and compare secrets
  with `hash_equals()`.
- Protect cookie-authenticated state changes with CSRF defenses. Set session
  cookies `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and an appropriate `SameSite` policy.
- Keep secrets, passwords, tokens, raw request bodies, and sensitive personal
  data out of logs and exception responses.
- Prefer explicit parsers or JSON for untrusted serialized data. Treat
  `unserialize()`, `eval()`, shell execution, file inclusion, and
  user-controlled paths as high-risk boundaries requiring a concrete
  justification and validation.

Completion criterion: each external input, rendered response, credential, and
side effect has an identified validation or containment rule.

### 5. Handle errors at the right layer

- Throw exceptions for failed operations. Define custom exceptions under the
  application namespace, usually extending the closest built-in or framework
  exception. Do not declare a class with the same global name as a built-in such
  as `DomainException` or `InvalidArgumentException`.
- Namespaced custom exceptions may extend built-ins:

```php
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Exception;

final class ValidationException extends \InvalidArgumentException {}
final class RuleViolationException extends \DomainException {}
```

- Catch an exception only to recover, translate it to the current boundary, add
  useful context, or perform cleanup. Preserve the previous exception when
  translating.
- At a raw process or HTTP boundary, catch `Throwable` to log safe context and
  return a generic response. In a framework, use its exception handler or
  middleware instead of adding a second global handler.
- When the project floor supports it, mark application APIs with
  `#[\Deprecated(message: ..., since: ...)]` when deprecating them, and keep an
  `E_USER_DEPRECATED` check in migration or CI tests.
- Never swallow an exception or return success after a failed side effect.
- Use `finally` for resource cleanup.

Completion criterion: every failure is either handled at its owning boundary,
propagated with context, or deliberately reported as an unresolved risk.

### 6. Use safe I/O defaults

- Validate user-controlled paths against an allowed root; do not let input
  select arbitrary files or commands.
- Check return values from filesystem and network operations, and surface
  failures with useful context.
- Use `finally` to close resources and clean up temporary state.
- Choose the clearest iteration. When available, use `array_find()`,
  `array_find_key()`, `array_any()`, and `array_all()` for direct short-circuit
  searches and predicates. Their callbacks receive the value and key; because
  `array_find()` returns `null` when it finds nothing, use `array_find_key()` or
  `array_any()` when a matching value may be null. `array_map()` is not
  automatically faster than a loop.
- Stream large files with a generator and always close resources:

```php
function readLines(string $path): \Generator
{
    $handle = fopen($path, 'rb');
    if ($handle === false) {
        throw new \RuntimeException("Cannot open {$path}");
    }

    try {
        while (($line = fgets($handle)) !== false) {
            yield rtrim($line, "\r\n");
        }
    } finally {
        fclose($handle);
    }
}
```

### 7. Keep Composer and deployment reproducible

- Use PSR-4 autoloading and namespaces. Keep application `composer.lock` under
  version control; follow the repository policy for libraries.
- Make the PHP and extension constraints in `composer.json` match the actual
  support matrix.
- Prefer the project's existing Composer scripts. Do not add or upgrade
  dependencies unless the task requires it.
- For a production application,
  `composer install --no-dev --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader` reads the
  lockfile when present, skips `require-dev`, prefers distribution archives, and
  builds an optimized PSR-4/PSR-0 classmap. Use the framework's deployment
  command or repository script when one exists; this is not a local development
  default.
- Treat OPcache settings as deployment decisions.
  `opcache.validate_timestamps=0` is safe only when deployments reliably restart
  or invalidate workers.

Completion criterion: dependency resolution, runtime constraints, and deployment
behavior agree with the declared support matrix.

## Verification

Run only checks relevant to the change:

- The relevant Composer test or application test command, including failure-path
  tests, when behavior changes.
- Configured static analysis and formatter checks, such as PHPStan, Psalm,
  PHP-CS-Fixer, or Pint, when the affected code or project policy requires them.
- `composer validate --strict`, `composer check-platform-reqs`, and
  `composer audit` when dependencies or Composer configuration change.
- A focused CLI, HTTP, queue, or integration smoke test when the changed
  behavior has an observable runtime surface.
- A final diff review for accidental API changes, leaked data, missing
  configuration or deployment steps, unhandled errors, and unsupported PHP
  syntax.

Completion criterion: relevant targeted checks cover the modified behavior, or
the exact unavailable check is reported; the final diff has no unexplained
behavior change.

## Quality bar

- Prefer the smallest change that preserves the project's existing architecture.
- Measure before optimizing; profile I/O, memory, and CPU hotspots instead of
  guessing. Treat lazy objects as an advanced optimization: prefer framework or
  library support, and use `ReflectionClass::newLazyGhost()` or
  `ReflectionClass::newLazyProxy()` only when measured initialization cost
  justifies them and lifecycle tests cover cloning, serialization, destruction,
  and failure paths.
- Let framework and project documentation own HTTP, ORM, session, and
  framework-testing conventions. Keep this skill focused on PHP language,
  runtime, security, dependency, and verification behavior.
